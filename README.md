Blazed Labs LLC: We turn dreams into reality.

## Who are you?
We are Blazed Labs, a Product Research & Development company founded in 2020 by [Tyler Ruff](https://github.com/tyler-ruff). Our founding managers also include [Matthew Ruff](https://github.com/matt-ruff).

## What do you do?
We make software, products, and media. We also provide some other services as well.

Each endeavour is only part of our greater mission to provide solutions to many common and uncommon problems using science and engineering.

## Why do you do that?
We believe the internet should be safe, fast, and simple/easy to use. In respect of those inheritly contradictory goals, we strive to achieve a fine balance between "business" and "research", as both benefit from the fruits of academia.

## Where are you located?
The Blazed Labs LLC company was founded in Ocean City, New Jersey; but we do business all over the world.
