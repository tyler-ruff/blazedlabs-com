There is no doubt about it, no matter what language or build platform one uses, all development is becoming more modular and more decentralized.

This is true mostly in the field of web development, so that is why we have been working to create Fire and Ice.

* Fire is just front end frameworks/boilerplate.
* Ice is just back end frameworks/boilerplate.

Together, they make websites that are simple, easy to maintain, and modular.
