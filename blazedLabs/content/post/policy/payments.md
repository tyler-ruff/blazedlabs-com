Depending on the customer's relationship with Blazed Labs, the deliverable may not be released until the invoice has been paid in full.

### RECEIPTS

## PROCUREMENT

### INTRODUCTION
Blazed Lab's goal for every purchasing transaction is to obtain the best value possible. Blazed Labs strives to
procure most goods and services through the use of contracts that have appropriate terms and
conditions to properly protect the company, employee, and vendor. When bids are
required by policy, they are to be conducted on an open and competitive basis and without
favoritism. Interested suppliers will receive fair and impartial consideration.

### ROLE OF PROCUREMENT AND PAYMENT SERVICES
Procurement and Payment Services (PPS) is the single point of contact for centralized procurement
activities. Their role is to help company make informed, best value purchasing
decisions, and to make sure products and services are purchased and paid for in the most
streamlined way, as well as assist company with all other purchasing and payment
related issues.

### AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
As stated above, Blazed Labs maintains a procurement environment that delegates considerable decision
making authority to company. Employees involved in the purchasing process take full
responsibility for understanding Blazed Lab's policies and procedures regarding purchasing and vendor
relations. Purchasing decisions are business decisions made on behalf of Blazed Labs and therefore should
be made with the utmost consideration for what is in the best interest of Blazed Labs.

### ETHICS
Ethical business standards shall govern all procurement transactions. Infractions of company
policy are to be reported to PPS, the department chair, the Blazed Labs Office for Audit and Advisory
Services, and an Officer of Blazed Labs. Disciplinary action for those violating ethical business standards
will be taken in accordance with applicable company policy, up to and including the termination of
employment.

### RECEIVING
A Receipt is the company's way of indicating that the product has been
received or service has been provided and therefore the PO is approved for payment. To
authorize payment, receipts must be entered as soon as possible after receiving the product or
service.

### INVOICES
A purchasing transaction is complete only after the goods or services
have been received and the supplier has been paid. When a PO is issued, the
company assumes responsibility to make sure the vendor is paid within an
appropriate period of time. Vendors are instructed to send invoices directly to AP for proper
processing. This is the best way to ensure invoices are paid in a timely manner

### BUY VERSUS LEASE PROCESS
Equipment should almost always be acquired by outright purchase. If leasing is determined to be
appropriate, the company should consult with the Budget Planning Office and their School
Administrator to determine if equipment should be leased or could be financed internally at a lower cost.
If it cannot be internally financed, the company should then consult with PPS and OGC to make
sure Blazed Labs and company are appropriately protected regarding such things as guarantees,
assignments, buy-out clauses, payment amount, interest rate, taxes, and other items. If sponsored
project funds are involved in the acquisition of the equipment, it must first be determined that the source
of funding allows for leasing.
Leasing may be advantageous if the total cost of a lease for the period of the equipment's life or the
technological life is less than the purchase price. The total cost of the lease must be compared to the
total cost of the purchase, taking into account such factors as equipment costs, maintenance costs,
interest, taxes, and insurance.

### CAPITAL EQUIPMENT/ASSET TRACKING
Capital Equipment is defined as property having a useful life of one year or more and a minimum acquisition
cost of $5,000 per unit. Capital equipment should be marked, tracked, and reported from time-to-time.

### ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
Environmental impact should be considered in purchasing decisions, when appropriate. Blazed Labs
encourages the company to consider the use of products and services that impact the
environment less than competing products, when it is a best value decision to do so. A best value
decision based on a thorough total cost of ownership analysis considers the initial cost of the item as
well as factors such as:
* **Energy Efficiency.** Purchase equipment that is Energy Star-rated (or, if there is no Energy Star
rating, equipment that is highly energy efficient). Energy Star is a program helping businesses and
individuals protect the environment through superior energy efficiency.
* **Shipping Materials.** Purchase products that are shipped in containers that are returnable or
reusable and made from recycled content (i.e. cardboard boxes). Also request bulk packaging
when multiple items are ordered for delivery at the same time.
* **Recycled Content.** Purchase products made with recycled content suitable for the intended use.
Look for a high percentage of post-consumer content. ‘Post-Consumer’ content is material that has
served its intended purpose and has been discarded for disposal or recovery by a business or
consumer. Other recycled content includes post-industrial wastes which are by-products of a
maBlazed Labsfacturing process that would normally not be reused in the process.
* **Other.** Environmental performance of the supplier and/or producer should also be considered,
such as waste prevention, waste reduction, pollution prevention, clean air and water programs, reuse of materials, minimization of scrap material, and any other green factory initiatives, etc. Blazed Labs
strongly desires to minimize the amount of waste sent to landfills. Both the product
purchased and the packaging materials associated with it should be minimized to prevent
waste as much as possible.
