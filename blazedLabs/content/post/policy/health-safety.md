# Workplace Health & Safety Policy
Blazed Labs LLC/Ruff Management Inc. (“the Company”) is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace, safe working methods, and the provision of safe equipment. Workplace health and safety is considered by management to be an integral and vital part of the successful performance of any job.

This policy sets out the responsibilities of the Company and its employees with the aim that together we can keep the workplace safe and productive.

In so far as this policy imposes any obligations on the Company (ie those additional to those set out under legislation), those obligations are not contractual and do not give rise to any contractual rights. To the extent that this policy describes beneﬁts and entitlements for employees (ie those additional to those set out under legislation), they are discretionary in nature and are also not intended to be contractual. The terms and conditions of employment that are intended to be contractual are set in an employee’s written employment contract.

The Company may unilaterally introduce, vary, remove or replace this policy at any time. The Company, as a person conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU), is committed to:

Meetings to consult and inform employees on safety issues shall be conducted through staﬀ meetings, as regularly as is necessary.
Employees shall be made aware of safety issues relating to their jobs on a regular basis. The manner of doing so will vary depending upon the type of information to be conveyed.
We expect our employees to be committed to working with management in order to eﬀectively manage health and safety on the job. Employees are encouraged to contribute to decisions that may aﬀect their health and safety in the workplace, through contact with management and staﬀ meetings.

Management shall work in conjunction with employees to review and update this, and other policies and procedures.
