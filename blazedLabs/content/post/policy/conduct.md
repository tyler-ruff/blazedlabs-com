# Employee Code of Conduct policy

This code of conduct for employees applies to each employee of Blazed Labs LLC regardless of start date, contractual agreement or employee rank. Failure to comply with the policies set forth may result in disciplinary action, which can include termination of employment. Per the contract an employee signed, all company employees are in fact bound by their contract to follow our code of conduct for employees on a daily basis while performing their duties. If an employee has a question or feels that a fellow co-worker or even the company is not meeting our commitment, we want to hear from you - do not stay silent. Contact your direct manager, HR, the Ethics and Compliance helpline or a government agency. We take our code of conduct seriously and we expect the same of our employees. **The following now outlines the specifics of our code of conduct for employees:**

## Compliance with law 
All Blazed Labs LLC employees are required to protect our company’s legality, therefore they should comply with all environmental, safety and fair dealing laws. We do expect employees to be ethical and responsible whenever dealing with our company finances, products, partnerships and public image. 

## Respect in the workplace 
All employees of Blazed Labs LLC are expected to respect their colleagues. We will not allow for any kind of discriminatory behavior, harassment or victimization. Employees should also conform with the equal opportunity policy in all aspects of their job duties. 

## Protection of company property 
All employees are expected to treat ABC Production’s property with respect and care. This means that employees: 
* Should not misuse company equipment or frivolously use it. 
* Should respect all incorporeal property such as trademarks, copyright and other property. Employees should, however, use them to complete their job duties only. 
* Should protect the company facilities and material property from damage and vandalism. 

## Professionalism at the workplace 
All employees are expected to act and show integrity and professionalism while in the workplace: 

### Personal appearance
When it comes to the personal appearance of an employee, we expect all employees to follow our dress code.

### Corruption 
We strongly discourage employees from accepting gifts from outside parties. We also prohibit bribery that can benefit an external or internal party. 

### Job duties and authority 
All employees should fulfill their job duties with integrity and respect toward customers, stakeholders and the community. Supervisors and managers mustn’t abuse their authority. We expect them to delegate duties to their team members taking into account their competences and workload. Likewise, we expect team members to follow team leaders’ instructions and complete their duties with skill and in a timely manner. 

**We encourage mentoring throughout our company.**

### Absenteeism and tardiness
Employees need to follow their schedules. However, there are exceptions that may prevent employees from following the standard working hours or days and we outline those in our Employee Attendance Policy. In any case, we do expect all employees to be punctual when clocking in and clocking out. 

### Conflict of interest 
Employees are expected to avoid any personal, financial or other interests which may hinder their capability or willingness to fulfill their job duties. 

### Collaboration 
At the workplace, employees are expected to act friendly and collaborative with everyone. We don’t want anyone to disrupt the workplace or create obstacles to colleagues' work.  

### Communication 
All employees are required to remain open for communication and dialogue with their co-workers, supervisors, team members, and third-party “employees” or clients. 

### Benefits 
All employees are expected to not abuse their employment benefits, including time off, holidays, insurance, facilities, company car, or other benefits we offer. 

### Policies 
All employees are required to read and follow all of our company policies. If you have any questions, ask your manager or the Human Resources (HR) department for assistance. Disciplinary actions We may take disciplinary action against any employees who have repeatedly or intentionally failed to follow our code of conduct. The disciplinary actions will vary based on the violation committed. Possible consequences include: 
* Demotion. 
* Reprimand. 
* Suspension or termination, when dealing with serious offenses. 
* Detraction of benefits for a specific amount of time. 

Blazed Labs LLC may take legal action if corruption, theft, embezzlement or other unlawful behavior takes place at any given time.
